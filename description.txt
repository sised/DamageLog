Challenger's Utility is a quality of life mod aimed towards challenge players (like nohitters) it has a few functions that can be enabled/disabled via config:

1: DAMAGE LOG
logs most types of damage in chat, includes: PVP, Enemies, Projectiles, Lava, Fall damage
Custom collision from other mods not supported.

2: CLEAR EVERYTHING ON DEATH
clears hostile NPCs and Projectiles on death

3: RECORDING LOG
tells you wether or not it is recording, set the shortcut to the same shortcut as start/stop on obs or whatever you're using, and make sure that it is synced (NOTE: The mod itself cannot record gameplay, you need a recording software!)
