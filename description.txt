Damage Log is a Quality of Life mod that prints a message every time you get hit, containing information about the hit. 

Includes:
Enemy damage, Projectile damage, fall damage, lava damage, PVP

Useful for challenge players.

example: "Player got hit by Plantera, 50 Damage!"

note: not sure if PVP works yet, haven't tested it (no friends ;-;)
